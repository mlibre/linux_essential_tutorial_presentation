"When I started working at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1971,
I became part of a software-sharing community that had existed for many years."

"As a member of this community, an AI Lab staff system hacker, my job was to improve this system."

"We did not call our software “free software”, because that term did not yet exist; but that is what it was."
,
"The collapse of the community"

"ITS were obsolete"

"The modern computers of the era, such as the VAX or the 68020,
had their own operating systems, but none of them were free software "

/ #copyleft

"Copyleft uses copyright law, but flips it over to serve the opposite of its usual purpose: instead of a means
for restricting a program, it becomes a means for keeping the program free."
,
"The principal goal of GNU is to be free software."
,
"The specific implementation of copyleft that we use for most GNU software is the GNU General Public License,
or GNU GPL for short."
,
"So we needed to use distribution terms that would prevent
GNU software from being turned into proprietary software. The method we use is called “copyleft”."
